<B>Wendy K. Tam Cho</B> is Professor of Computer Science and 
Political Science at Vanderbilt University, an affiliate
at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications and
Professor Emerita at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,
and Professional Researcher in the School of Medicine at the University
of California at San Francisco.  She received her Ph.D from U.C. Berkeley.

<P>
Her general research interests are in the development of computational
and statistical models across varied applications.  Her research is
driven by a desire to discover creative and important ways for societal
advances to march alongside scientific and technological innovation.
Her work is highly interdisciplinary, capitalizing on the strengths of
many individual disciplines by recognizing and integrating them into a
collective approach.  Her aim is to harness the power of information
by developing statistical and mathematical models to guide computing
technology toward intelligent information extraction.  Her scholarly
publications have appeared in the fields of Political Science,
Geography, Statistics, Economics, Computer Science, High Performance
Computing, Operations Research, Physics, Medicine, Asian American Studies,
Racial and Ethnic Politics, and Law.  Her research has been supported
by grants from the National Science Foundation (NSF) as well as computing
allocation grants on the Blue Waters supercomputer, the SDSC Comet
supercomputer, the TACC Stampede2 supercomputer, the PSC Bridges-2
supercomputer, and the NCSA Delta supercomputer.

<P>
Her research has won writing competitions, received best paper awards,
and been recognized with the High Performance Computing Innovation
Excellence Award.  Her teaching has often been ranked as excellent
by her students.  She has also been awarded fellowships by the John
Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, the Society for Political
Methodology, and the Hoover Institution as well as the Center for
Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University.

<P>
She has been a member of a number of advisory boards including the
Board of Reviewing Editors for <I>Science</I> magazine, the
Committee of Visitors for the NSF's Social, Behavior, and Economic
Sciences Division, the Educational Advisory Board of the John Simon
Guggenheim Foundation, PI4, an NSF funded program to broaden the
research background and career prospects of mathematics graduate
students, and President Obama's Commission on Election Administration,
as well as a member of eight different NSF Review Panels spanning
directorates in political science, statistics, big data, and
engineering.  She has served on the Executive Council of the
American Political Science Association, as editor of the journal,
<I>Political Analysis</I>, as a member of the editorial board for
a dozen journals, and as a reviewer for over 145 different academic
journals, agencies, foundations, or presses, spanning more than a
dozen disciplines.

<P>
She has a passion for beautiful mathematics and regularly teaches 
mathematics to children in math circles and summer camps.  When
not thinking about math or research, you can find her wandering the
world on foot or in pursuit of her youth on the soccer field.
